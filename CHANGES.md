* renamed superstructure to metastructure and metastructure to infrastructure to not confuse a module with the project. this naming makes way more sense anyway
* started to get really unsure about the whole logical form thing. if the a.allgemeinheit == b and b.einzelheit == a and a.besonderheit == ... scratch that, it does make sense
* Allgemeinheit and Einzelheit as classes however appear questionable; maybe even use even more abstract language? negative?
* just realized from AbstrakteAllgemeinheit: it should actually be the class Allgemeinheit..


## June 6
* defining abstract concepts that fold into themselves and are interconnected is pretty hard to do when restricted by a language that is interpreted bottom up, not top down
* I have extreme issues even desciding on a set of core "structures". I am not even sure whether the most basic whatchamacallit should outline a thing or a relation. but the good news is, that on this level, I dont even see a difference between the two. I guess I should have read that book on category theory...
* deciding on using German terms is still not final for me. right now it helps me think, but object.is_bestimmt() just feels really wrong
* it is quite unclear to me, why there has to be a set of necessary Begriffe next to the basic structure for it to survive.. Hegel says they are necessary consequences of the basic structure but.. I mean it would be cool if my structure could at some point just generate them itself on startup (without the particular names.. -> this reminds me, Begriffe/Things shouldnt be identifiable through their names, but by their particular structure! no 2 Begriffe can share the same predicates in relation to themselves and others)
* thus, if we have the basic structures thing and relation defined (through themselves), we have a basic set of certain necessary combinations.
* end of day: this looks and feels extremely wrong, but also I dont have a better idea as of know
