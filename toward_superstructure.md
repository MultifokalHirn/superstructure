# Toward superstructure

* In this document I try to quickly sum up my interpretation of the evolution of the ideas of the Western world, which I habit.
* The goal is to contextualize superstructure and to thus clarify where I am coming from with it.


## Pure Nothingness
> Where there is not difference between Being and absolute Absence

* Unreflected Existence would just as much be Inexistence


## Unity in Stasis (Being)
> Where the Whole is the Whole and there is nothing else

### Theology - The Unity in God
* All came from God

### Idealism - The Unity of Mind as the Whole
* Nature is only a part of the Mind

### Materialism - The Unity of Nature as the Whole
* Mind is only a part of Nature

## Disjunction in Process (Becoming)
> Where the Wholes recognize their Disjunction and move towards each other

### Dualism - The Disjunction of Mind and Nature
* Mind and Nature are seperate but aware of each other

### Transcendental Idealism - The Unity of the Disjunction of Mind and Nature
* Mind and Nature are seperate but intertwined

## Unity in Process (Becoming)
> Where the Whole moves towards its highest state

### Absolute Idealism - The Unity of the Disjunction
* From the most basic Whole toward the absolute whole
* Hegel: from every Disjunction follows its Unification naturally

### Dialectical Materialism - The Disjunction of the Unity
* The incomplete units of the Whole move toward their own completion
* Marx: in every affair there is a battle of self assertion
    * Each Unit, by always being forced to coexist with its opposite in their joint affair, has to fight its opposite to assert itself as a new independent Whole

## Disjunction in Stasis (Being)
> Where the Disjunction is the Disjunction

### Logicism - The Disjunction of Disjunction and Unity
* [Carnap](https://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/carn1a.html#dies): disjunction as the first axiom of formal logic
    * Overlooking the fundamentality of disjunctions between ideas and phenomena was the fundamental error of past thinkers!
* Logical Atomism: *atoms are disjunct and a disjunction can not be an atom*
    * Russell - [The Antihegel](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Logic+as+the+Essence+of+Philosophy)?
    * Russell understands propositional logic as proving the Hegelian dialectic wrong:
    *   *"But to say “the particular is the universal” is self-contradictory. Again Hegel does not suspect a mistake but proceeds to synthesise particular and universal in the individual, or concrete universal. This is an example of how, for want of care at the start, vast and imposing systems of philosophy are built upon stupid and trivial confusions, which, but for the almost incredible fact that they are unintentional, one would be tempted to characterise as puns."*
* Wittgenstein (the early one) - the abyss is staring back at itself
    * *"What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent."*
        * The Completion of Formal Logic as degenerate Tautology
    * *"[...] the truth of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken in this, then the value of this work secondly consists in the fact that it shows how little has been done when these problems have been solved."*
        * Do you think that he was in on the joke?
* Gödel: any consistent and sufficiently complex formal axiomatic system contains
    * **The epitome of the potency of formal logic, the proof, ultimately reveals its own impotence**

## Process in Unity and Unity in Process (Becoming)
> Where there is only Movement of the Whole, which is the Unity of the Disjunction of Movement (Becoming) And Stasis (Being)

### Cybernetics - The Unity of the Disjunction of Being as Data and Becoming as Process
* Whitehead: process philosophy (?)
* Lawvere: *"It is my belief that in the next decade and in the next century the technical advances forged by category theorists will be of value to dialectical philosophy, lending precise form with disputable mathematical models to ancient philosophical distinctions such as general vs. particular, objective vs. subjective, being vs. becoming, space vs. quantity, equality vs. difference, quantitative vs. qualitative etc. In turn the explicit attention by mathematicians to such philosophical questions is necessary to achieve the goal of making mathematics (and hence other sciences) more widely learnable and useable. Of course this will require that philosophers learn mathematics and that mathematicians learn philosophy."*

* The natural evolution from binary data-processes to dialectical process-data
