# metastructure
> [metastructure](https://github.com/MultifokalHirn/superstructure/blob/dev/superstructure/metastructure) constitutes the logical backend

## Basics
This package is a library filled with classes and functions. `metastructure` is modelled after the author's (ever changing) understanding of the basic structure of the Hegelian dialectic. The basic idea is that information must always be structured in such a way, that it is the content of a particular mind (_Bewusstsein_) and that it therefore can only exist in relation to other information. There is no information '_outside_' a mind and there is a (very limited) set of rules, that information must obey. This may appear to limit what can be represented within such a framework, but _a)_ this is an illusion and _b)_ it enables the structure to generate new knowledge and connections on its own.
